/**
 * Brand fonts (S1-P08-T002, SC-HDR-02): served from our own origin, never Google, at build time *or* runtime.
 *
 * `next/font/google` self-hosts the files it ships, but it downloads them from Google during `next build`, so every
 * build depended on fonts.googleapis.com answering with exactly the CSS shape its parser expects. When it did not,
 * the build died with `Cannot read properties of null (reading '1')` inside the font loader — three times on
 * 2026-09-25 alone, on unrelated commits [fact: CI runs 36122364595, 36125556735]. A build that needs a third party
 * to be up is a build that fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the change being built.
 *
 * The two latin variable files are vendored in `app/fonts/` instead. One file per family covers every weight used
 * (Plus Jakarta Sans 400–700, Playfair Display 400–900), the bytes are identical to what the loader fetched, and the
 * build is now reproducible offline. Re-download from Google Fonts only to pick up a new font version.

// root element to the person's saved light/dark/system choice before the first paint (ADR-016). A restaurant's public
// page sets its own theme on its page wrapper and is unaffected (ADR-013 §6). The script changes the root element's
// attributes before React hydrates, hence suppressHydrationWarning on that one element.
