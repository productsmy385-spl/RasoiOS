 * LD-PUB-03 sitemap (S1-P09-T005). Lists the public website of every ACTIVE tenant whose site is published, and
 * nothing else: a suspended tenant and an unpublished website are simply absent, exactly as they are absent from the
 * page itself (ADR-012 §7). No console, platform or account route is ever listed.
 *
 * Each restaurant is listed at its canonical sub-domain when `PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` is configured, and at the path form
 * otherwise, so the sitemap always matches the `<link rel="canonical">` the page emits (ADR-012 §2).

/**
 * Generated per request, not at build time. `/sitemap.xml` is a static path, so with a `revalidate` export Next
 * prerenders it during `next build` — which made the build query the database, and a build that needs a live database
 * fails wherever one is not reachable yet [fact: Vercel build 6uBtE2956, 2026-09-23, "Error occurred prerendering page
 * /sitemap.xml"]. Building and running are separate concerns; only running should need the data.
 *
 * Crawlers fetch this rarely, so one query per request costs nothing worth saving, and the answer is always current.
