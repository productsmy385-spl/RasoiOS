/**
 * Applying a tenant theme to its own public page (S1-P09-T012; RASOIOS-ADR-013 §6).
 *
 * `lib/services/website-theme.ts` resolves and contrast-checks the palette and hands back `cssVariables` — the
 * documented `--site-*` contract. This module turns that resolved theme into the inline style of the *page root
 * element only*, and does two things there:
 *
 * 1. sets the `--site-*` variables verbatim, so anything that wants the raw tenant colours can read them;
 * 2. re-points the semantic tokens the design system already paints with (`--primary`, `--surface`, …) to the same
 *    colours, expressed as `R G B` channels because `tailwind.config.ts` writes them as `rgb(var(--token) / alpha)`.
 *
 * Because both live in a `style` attribute on one element, the whole effect is scoped to that subtree: the console
 * shares the stylesheet but never renders inside it, and no tenant value can reach another tenant's page or the
 * platform brand. The surface mode is applied as `data-theme`, which `app/globals.css` already defines, so a
 * restaurant that chose a light website gets light surfaces, borders and muted text instead of inheriting the
 * dark console theme.
